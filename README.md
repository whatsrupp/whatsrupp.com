# Whatsrupp Webpage

A half baked attempt to put all my things and thoughts into one place. It's all rather self-absorbed if I stop and think about it for too long. But, I figured it might show that I'm at least, in some shape or form, seriously enthusiastic about creating web-apps!

I have decided to try and compartmentalise my online life into 6 main sections:

- Coding
- Graphic Design
- Photography
- Modelling
- Engineering
- Writing

Each section will then have a little bit about what I get up to and I'll keep it updated from time to time -
That's about it really!
